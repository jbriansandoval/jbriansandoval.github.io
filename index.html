	  <img src="assets/images/m.jpg">
	    <p>My name is Jose Brian Sandoval, but I prefer my name Brian.  I graduated from Johnson & Wales University February 2017, with my B.S. in Business Administration.  It seems so long, yet it hasn't been a year. As a student I have done a lot of searching for myself over the past years, specifically through school and work.
      <p>Having worked in various management and leadership roles, I now appreciate the tremendous experience that I gained.   I find that I tend to lose focus, when I am not challenged. I really enjoy fast paced work environments. I tend to think in terms of the “big picture” and have found that I am truly great at problem solving and thinking on my feet.</p>
